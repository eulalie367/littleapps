            <h2>Re-roofing - Tear off and Recovers</h2>
            <p>
	            Re-roofing is the process of installing a new roof when a roofing system fails. Roofing system failures can be caused by a number of factors, including age, severe weather, poor workmanship, defective materials, improper specification of a roofing system, abuse and failure to maintain the roof via inspections.

            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <p>
                Maintenance involves the physical inspection of an existing roofing system to determine it`s current condition, detect weakness and failures and identify any potential future problems. Through a program of regularly scheduled annual or semiannual inspections, the company`s technicians assist owner in protecting their roofing investments by seeking to identify damage in its early stages. Early detection of leaks and roof system failures make it possible for the company to repair and extend the life of a roof system, which is significantly less expensive and time consuming than re-roofing.
